# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

All development MUST align with Candy-Cadence Constitution v1.0.0:

**Performance Mandate Check:**
- Load times: <5s (<100MB), <15s (100-500MB), <30s (>500MB)
- Memory usage: <2GB during typical operations, no leaks allowed
- Frame rates: minimum 30 FPS during model interaction
- Performance testing required for all loading/rendering features

**Modular Architecture Check:**
- Single responsibility principle implemented
- Clean, documented interfaces between modules
- Independent testability maintained
- Dependencies flow one direction (no circular references)

**Quality Assurance Check:**
- Comprehensive JSON logging (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Unit tests for all functions, integration tests for workflows
- Memory leak testing (10-20 iterations)
- Inline documentation for all public functions
- Performance benchmarking for load time verification
- All code passes linting before integration

**User Sovereignty Check:**
- Complete offline operation with no remote execution
- All user data remains local under user control
- SQLite database management for local storage
- No telemetry, analytics, or external communication
- Privacy by design: no user behavior tracking

**Windows Integration Check:**
- Windows desktop application conventions followed
- OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile minimum, DirectX 11.0 via ANGLE fallback
- Python 3.8-3.12, PySide6 6.0.0+, VTK 9.2.0+, SQLite 3.0+ compatibility
- Context menus and Windows shell integration
- Inno Setup installer with proper registry integration

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
