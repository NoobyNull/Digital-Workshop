# Screenshot Generation Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive screenshot generation system for the 3D Model Manager that allows users to capture screenshots of all models in the library with applied materials. The screenshots are displayed as thumbnails in the grid view.

## Components Created

### 1. ScreenshotGenerator (`src/gui/screenshot_generator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Captures individual model screenshots with applied materials
- **Key Features**:
  - Off-screen rendering using VTK
  - Configurable screenshot size (default 256x256)
  - Material application support
  - Automatic lighting setup
  - PNG export functionality
  - Error handling and logging

- **Main Methods**:
  - `capture_model_screenshot()`: Captures a single model with optional material
  - `_load_model()`: Loads model from file
  - `_create_actor_from_model()`: Creates VTK actor from model data
  - `_setup_lighting()`: Configures scene lighting
  - `_save_screenshot()`: Saves rendered image to PNG

### 2. BatchScreenshotWorker (`src/gui/batch_screenshot_worker.py`)
- **Purpose**: Background worker thread for batch screenshot generation
- **Key Features**:
  - Processes all models in the library sequentially
  - Emits progress signals for UI updates
  - Stores screenshots in `~/.3dmm/thumbnails/` directory
  - Updates database with thumbnail paths
  - Supports cancellation via `stop()` method
  - Comprehensive error handling

- **Signals**:
  - `progress_updated(current, total)`: Progress updates
  - `screenshot_generated(model_id, path)`: Individual screenshot completion
  - `error_occurred(message)`: Error notifications
  - `finished_batch()`: Batch completion

### 3. Database Updates (`src/core/database_manager.py`)
- **Changes**:
  - Added `thumbnail_path` to valid update fields in `update_model()`
  - Added convenience method `update_model_thumbnail(model_id, path)`
  - Existing `thumbnail_path` column in models table used for storage

### 4. Menu Integration (`src/gui/components/menu_manager.py`)
- **Changes**:
  - Added "Tools" menu to menu bar
  - Added "Generate Screenshots for Library" action
  - Connected to main window handler

### 5. Main Window Integration (`src/gui/main_window.py`)
- **New Methods**:
  - `_generate_library_screenshots()`: Initiates batch screenshot generation
  - `_on_screenshot_progress()`: Handles progress updates
  - `_on_screenshot_generated()`: Handles individual screenshot completion
  - `_on_screenshot_error()`: Handles errors
  - `_on_screenshots_finished()`: Handles batch completion and UI refresh

- **Features**:
  - Progress bar display during generation
  - Status bar updates
  - Automatic model library refresh after completion
  - User notification on completion
  - Error handling with user feedback

### 6. Model Library Grid View Updates (`src/gui/model_library.py`)
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `_update_model_view()` to load and display thumbnail icons
  - Icons loaded from `thumbnail_path` in database
  - Graceful fallback if thumbnail not found
  - Fixed import paths for compatibility

## Workflow

### User Interaction
1. User opens the application
2. Models are loaded into the library
3. User selects **Tools → Generate Screenshots for Library**
4. Progress dialog appears showing generation status
5. Screenshots are generated for each model with materials applied
6. Database is updated with thumbnail paths
7. Model library automatically refreshes
8. Grid view displays generated screenshots as icons

### Technical Flow
1. `_generate_library_screenshots()` creates `BatchScreenshotWorker`
2. Worker thread iterates through all models from database
3. For each model:
   - Load model file
   - Create VTK actor
   - Apply material (if available)
   - Render to off-screen buffer
   - Save as PNG to `~/.3dmm/thumbnails/`
   - Update database with thumbnail path
   - Emit progress signal
4. After completion:
   - Reload model library from database
   - Grid view displays new thumbnails
   - Show completion message

## File Locations
- **Screenshots**: `~/.3dmm/thumbnails/model_{id}.png`
- **Database**: Thumbnail paths stored in `models.thumbnail_path` column

## Features
- ✅ Batch screenshot generation for all models
- ✅ Material application during rendering
- ✅ Progress tracking and UI updates
- ✅ Automatic database updates
- ✅ Grid view thumbnail display
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Cancellation support
- ✅ Off-screen rendering (no window flashing)

## Usage
1. Open 3D-MM application
2. Add models to library (if not already present)
3. Go to **Tools → Generate Screenshots for Library**
4. Wait for generation to complete
5. Switch to Grid view in Model Library to see thumbnails

## Technical Details
- Uses VTK for off-screen rendering
- PIL/Pillow for image handling
- SQLite for thumbnail path persistence
- Qt signals for thread-safe UI updates
- Configurable screenshot size (default 256x256)
- Automatic cache directory creation

## Future Enhancements
- Batch screenshot generation with custom materials
- Screenshot quality settings
- Thumbnail regeneration for specific models
- Screenshot preview before saving
- Custom lighting configurations per model
