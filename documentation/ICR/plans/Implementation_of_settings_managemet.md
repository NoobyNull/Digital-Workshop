1. Settings Inventory and Analysis
1.1 Current Settings Storage Analysis
Based on codebase analysis, the current settings implementation uses multiple storage mechanisms:

| Storage Mechanism | Location | Usage | Settings Stored | Access Pattern |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| QSettings | Platform-specific (Registry on Windows, JSON on others) | Primary persistent storage | Window dimensions, startup behavior, viewer settings, theme settings | Direct QSettings() calls throughout codebase |
| ApplicationConfig | src/core/application_config.py | Default values and metadata | All application defaults, feature flags, resource limits | Singleton access via ApplicationConfig.get_default() |
| JSON Settings | settings.json in AppData | Migration and version tracking | Migration history, version information | Used by settings_migration.py |
| Direct File Access | Various locations | Temporary/cache data | Thumbnail cache, model cache, temporary files | Direct file I/O operations |

1.2 Settings Categories and Locations
| Category | Current Storage | Settings Examples | Storage Location | Access Method |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Window Management | QSettings | default_width, default_height, maximize_on_startup, remember_window_size | QSettings with keys "window/" | Direct QSettings access |
| 3D Viewer Settings | QSettings + ApplicationConfig | grid_visible, grid_color, ground_visible, ground_color, auto_fit_on_load | QSettings with fallback to ApplicationConfig defaults | Mixed: QSettings + ApplicationConfig.get_default() |
| Camera Controls | ApplicationConfig | mouse_sensitivity, fps_limit, zoom_speed, pan_speed | ApplicationConfig dataclass | ApplicationConfig.get_default() |
| Lighting Settings | QSettings | position_x/y/z, color_r/g/b, intensity, cone_angle | QSettings with keys "lighting/" | Direct QSettings access |
| Theme Settings | QSettings + JSON | theme_name, theme_variant, custom_colors | QSettings + theme persistence JSON files | Mixed: QSettings + JSON files |
| Performance Settings | ApplicationConfig | enable_hardware_acceleration, enable_high_dpi, max_memory_usage_mb | ApplicationConfig dataclass | ApplicationConfig.get_default() |
| Logging Settings | ApplicationConfig | log_level, enable_file_logging, log_retention_days | ApplicationConfig dataclass | ApplicationConfig.get_default() |
| Thumbnail Settings | ApplicationConfig | thumbnail_bg_color, thumbnail_bg_image, thumbnail_material | ApplicationConfig dataclass | ApplicationConfig.get_default() |

1.3 Settings Access Patterns Analysis
Pattern	Frequency	Examples	Issues Identified
Direct QSettings Access	High	settings.setValue("key", value) throughout codebase	No centralized validation, inconsistent error handling
ApplicationConfig Singleton	Medium	config = ApplicationConfig.get_default()	Thread safety concerns, no change notifications
Mixed QSettings + Config	Medium	Load from QSettings, fallback to ApplicationConfig defaults	Inconsistent default value management
Settings Manager Pattern	Low	SettingsManager().save_*() methods	Limited to specific settings categories
1.4 Critical Issues Identified
No Change Detection: No mechanism to detect when settings are modified
No Visual Feedback: Users unaware of unsaved changes
No Session Management: No temporary settings capability
Inconsistent Access Patterns: Multiple ways to access settings with different behaviors
No Validation: Settings values stored without type checking or range validation
Thread Safety: Current patterns not thread-safe for concurrent access
No Notification System: No way to notify components of settings changes
