## üé≠ Mode Selection Decision Tree

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[New Task] --> B{Planning/Design Needed?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Architect Mode]
    B -->|No| D{Implementation Needed?}
    D -->|Yes| E{Code Review Needed?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Code Reviewer Mode]
    E -->|No| G[Code Mode]
    D -->|No| H{Information Needed?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Ask Mode]
    H -->|No| J{Troubleshooting Needed?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Debug Mode]
    J -->|No| L{Multi-Step Coordination?}
    L -->|Yes| M[Orchestrator Mode]
    L -->|No| N[Return to Previous Mode]
```

## ‚ö° Task Execution Workflow

### **Standard Implementation Pattern**
```python
def execute_todo(todo_item):
    """
    Standard workflow for todo execution
    """
    # 1. Mode Selection
    appropriate_mode = select_mode_for_todo(todo_item)

    # 2. Pre-Execution Checks
    verify_prerequisites(todo_item)
    check_dependencies(todo_item)

    # 3. Execution
    switch_to_mode(appropriate_mode)
    implement_todo(todo_item)

    # 4. Quality Gates
    run_tests(todo_item)
    update_progress(todo_item)

    # 5. Next Todo Selection
    select_next_todo()
```

### **Todo Execution Checklist**
- [ ] **Prerequisites Met**: Required components exist
- [ ] **Dependencies Available**: All needed tools/resources ready
- [ ] **Mode Appropriate**: Right mode for the task
- [ ] **Success Criteria Clear**: Know when todo is complete
- [ ] **Testing Plan**: How to verify completion

---

## üéØ Todo Selection Algorithm

### **Priority Matrix**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Available Todos] --> B{Is it Phase 1 Foundation?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Execute Phase 1 Todo]
    B -->|No| D{Is it Blocking Other Work?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Execute Blocking Todo]
    D -->|No| F{Is it High Risk?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Execute Risk Mitigation Todo]
    F -->|No| H{Is it Quick Win?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Execute Quick Win Todo]
    H -->|No| J[Execute Next Logical Todo]
```

### **Phase-Based Progression**
1. **Complete Phase 1** before Phase 2
2. **Complete Phase 2** before Phase 3
3. **Complete Phase 3** before Phase 4
4. **No phase skipping** unless explicitly approved

---

## üö® Exception Handling

### **When Things Go Wrong**
```python
def handle_todo_failure(todo_item, error):
    """
    Handle failed todo execution
    """
    # 1. Log the failure
    logger.error(f"Todo {todo_item} failed: {error}")

    # 2. Determine root cause
    switch_to_debug_mode()
    analyze_error(error)

    # 3. Fix or get clarification
    if technical_issue:
        switch_to_code_mode()
        implement_fix()
    else:
        switch_to_ask_mode()
        get_clarification()

    # 4. Retry or adjust
    retry_todo_or_adjust_plan()
```

### **Blocking Issue Resolution**
1. **Identify blocking todo**
2. **Switch to appropriate mode**
3. **Resolve blocking issue**
4. **Return to original task**
5. **Continue progression**

---

## üìä Progress Management

### **Todo Status Tracking**
```python
TODO_STATUS = {
    "pending": "Not yet started",
    "in_progress": "Currently working",
    "completed": "Successfully finished",
    "blocked": "Waiting for dependencies",
    "cancelled": "No longer needed"
}
```

### **Phase Gate Criteria**
**Phase 1 Gate:**
- [ ] Logging system implemented and tested
- [ ] Basic PySide5 application structure works
- [ ] Database operations functional

**Phase 2 Gate:**
- [ ] 3D viewer displays STL files
- [ ] Model library interface operational
- [ ] Basic metadata editing works

**Phase 3 Gate:**

---

## üîß Quality Assurance Integration

### **Code Quality Checks**
- **Code Reviewer Mode**: After major component completion
- **Code Skeptic Mode**: For critical path components
- **Test Engineer Mode**: Before phase transitions

### **Consistency Enforcement**
- **Logging Standards**: All components use consistent logging
- **Error Handling**: Uniform error handling patterns
- **UI Patterns**: Consistent user interface elements

---

## üéØ Next Steps for 3D-MM

### **Immediate Action Plan**
1. **Current Mode**: Architect ‚úÖ
2. **Next Todo**: Implement logging system

    "Create log file naming with timestamp and level",
    "Integrate logging throughout application",
    "Basic PySide5 application structure",
    "Database foundation implementation"
]

for todo in todos_to_execute:
    execute_todo_with_quality_gates(todo)
```

## üéµ Script Execution

**To Start Implementation:**
1. **Begin in Architect mode** (current mode) ‚úÖ
2. **Switch to Code mode** for logging system implementation
3. **Use Ask mode** for PySide5/PyQt3D documentation research
4. **Switch to Code mode** for core implementation
5. **Use Debug mode** for any issues encountered
6. **Return to Architect mode** for major design decisions

**Mode Switching Guidelines:**
- **Stay in Code mode** for implementation sprints
- **Switch to Ask mode** when needing external information
- **Use Debug mode** immediately when issues arise
- **Return to Architect mode** for planning adjustments

---

## üìã Mode Transition Rules

### **From Architect:**
- ‚úÖ **To Code**: After design approval
- ‚úÖ **To Ask**: When research needed
- ‚ùå **To Debug**: Only if design issues found

### **From Code:**
- ‚úÖ **To Ask**: When technical clarification needed
- ‚úÖ **To Debug**: When implementation issues found
- ‚úÖ **To Architect**: When design changes needed
- ‚úÖ **To Code Reviewer**: For quality checkpoints

### **From Ask:**
- ‚úÖ **To Architect**: After gathering information
- ‚úÖ **To Code**: With clear implementation path
- ‚úÖ **To Debug**: When issue research complete

### **From Debug:**
- ‚úÖ **To Code**: After issue resolution
- ‚úÖ **To Ask**: When more information needed
- ‚úÖ **To Architect**: When systemic issues found
