- **AND** clean up all resources
- **AND** return to previous application state

### Requirement: Progressive Loading and LOD Management
The system SHALL implement progressive loading with Level of Detail (LOD) management for optimal memory usage and user experience.

#### Scenario: Progressive model display

- **THEN** a low-detail preview SHALL display immediately
- **AND** detail level SHALL increase progressively
- **AND** user SHALL be able to interact with partial model

#### Scenario: Memory-adaptive LOD
- **WHEN** system memory is constrained
- **THEN** LOD SHALL automatically reduce
- **AND** maintain smooth interaction performance
- **AND** preserve model integrity

### Requirement: Memory-Efficient Processing
The system SHALL implement memory-efficient processing strategies to handle large files within system RAM limits.

#### Scenario: Streaming file processing
- **WHEN** processing files larger than available RAM
- **THEN** the system SHALL use memory-mapped files
- **AND** process data in streaming fashion
- **AND** limit peak memory usage to <2.5GB for 2GB files

#### Scenario: Resource cleanup
- **WHEN** loading operation completes or fails
- **THEN** all temporary resources SHALL be cleaned up
- **AND** memory usage SHALL return to baseline
- **AND** no memory leaks SHALL occur over 20 repeated operations

### Requirement: Unified Acceleration Framework
The system SHALL provide a unified GPU acceleration framework that all parsers can utilize for consistent performance across formats.

#### Scenario: Framework integration
- **WHEN** implementing GPU acceleration for a new format
- **THEN** the framework SHALL provide common GPU memory management

- **AND** consistent performance characteristics

#### Scenario: Hardware detection and optimization
- **WHEN** application starts
- **THEN** the system SHALL detect available GPU capabilities
- **AND** select optimal processing strategy
- **AND** provide clear feedback about acceleration status

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Load Time Performance
The system SHALL achieve the following load time targets with GPU acceleration enabled:

- 3D model files under 100MB: < 3 seconds (improved from <5)
- 3D model files 100-500MB: < 10 seconds (improved from <15)
- 3D model files over 500MB: < 30 seconds (improved from 120-160)

#### Scenario: Performance validation
- **WHEN** benchmarking load times on target hardware (24GB GPU, 128GB RAM)
- **THEN** all targets SHALL be met consistently
- **AND** performance SHALL scale with file size appropriately

### Requirement: UI Responsiveness During Loading
The system SHALL maintain UI responsiveness during all loading operations with no blocking operations >100ms.

#### Scenario: UI thread monitoring
- **WHEN** loading large files in background
- **THEN** UI event loop SHALL respond within 100ms
- **AND** user interactions SHALL be smooth
- **AND** progress updates SHALL not cause UI lag

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Single-Threaded Parsing
**Reason**: Replaced by GPU-accelerated multi-threaded processing for better performance.
**Migration**: Single-threaded parsing remains available as fallback when GPU acceleration fails.
