## Context

The current loading system blocks the UI thread for 120-160 seconds when loading 1GB files, creating an unacceptable user experience. The system needs to leverage the user's high-end hardware (24GB GPU, 128GB RAM) to achieve <30-second load times while maintaining UI responsiveness.

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals:
- Achieve <30-second load times for 1GB files across all formats
- Maintain UI responsiveness during loading operations
- Provide progress feedback and cancellation capability
- Leverage GPU acceleration for geometry processing
- Implement memory-efficient processing for large files
- Create unified acceleration framework for all parsers

### Non-Goals:
- Implement caching (focus on parsing optimization only)
- Support for files larger than available system RAM
- Real-time collaborative editing features
- Network-based distributed processing

## Decisions

### Architecture Choice: GPU-Accelerated Multi-Threaded Pipeline
**Decision**: Implement a GPU-accelerated, multi-threaded chunked processing pipeline with background loading coordination.

**Rationale**:
- GPU acceleration provides 10-50x performance improvement for geometry processing
- Multi-threading utilizes all CPU cores for I/O and coordination
- Chunked processing enables memory-efficient handling of large files
- Background loading maintains UI responsiveness

**Alternatives Considered**:
- CPU-only multi-threading: Insufficient performance for 1GB files
- Distributed processing: Overkill for single-user desktop application
- Streaming processing only: Doesn't leverage GPU capabilities

### Unified Acceleration Framework
**Decision**: Create a unified GPU acceleration framework that all parsers (STL, OBJ, STEP, 3MF) can utilize.

**Rationale**:
- Consistent performance across all supported formats
- Shared GPU memory management and error handling
- Easier maintenance and feature development
- Leverages existing NumPy acceleration in STL parser

### Progressive Loading Strategy
**Decision**: Implement progressive loading with Level of Detail (LOD) management and background processing.

**Rationale**:
- Users can see partial results immediately
- Memory usage scales with viewport requirements
- Cancellation becomes more responsive
- Better user experience for large models

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Technical Risks:
- **GPU Memory Management**: Risk of GPU memory exhaustion with large models
  - **Mitigation**: Implement adaptive chunk sizing and GPU memory monitoring
- **Thread Safety**: Complex coordination between GPU, CPU threads, and UI
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and thread-safe data structures
- **Platform Compatibility**: CUDA/OpenCL availability across different GPUs
  - **Mitigation**: Graceful fallback to CPU processing

### Performance Risks:
- **Memory Pressure**: Large files may exceed system RAM limits
  - **Mitigation**: Streaming processing and memory-mapped files
- **GPU Overhead**: Context switching and data transfer overhead
  - **Mitigation**: Minimize CPU-GPU data transfers, batch operations

### User Experience Risks:
- **Complexity**: Users may be confused by progressive loading behavior
  - **Mitigation**: Clear UI indicators and user education
- **Cancellation Responsiveness**: Large chunks may delay cancellation
  - **Mitigation**: Smaller chunk sizes and frequent cancellation checks

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization (Weeks 13-14)
- Performance benchmarking and optimization

### Rollback Strategy:
- Feature flags for each major component
- Fallback to original single-threaded parsing
- Gradual rollout with monitoring
- Quick rollback capability if performance regressions detected
