## Why

The current 3D model loading system experiences significant performance bottlenecks when handling large files (200MB-1GB+), with load times exceeding 120-160 seconds for 1GB files. This creates a poor user experience with UI freezing and no progress feedback or cancellation capability. The target is to achieve <30-second load times for 1GB files across all supported formats (STL, OBJ, STEP, 3MF) while maintaining UI responsiveness.

## What Changes

- **BREAKING**: Refactor parsing pipeline to use GPU-accelerated, multi-threaded chunked processing
- **BREAKING**: Implement unified acceleration framework for all file formats
- **BREAKING**: Add background loading with progress feedback and cancellation support
- **BREAKING**: Introduce progressive loading and memory management strategies

### Technical Changes:
1. Create GPU-accelerated parsing pipeline using CUDA/OpenCL for geometry processing
2. Implement multi-threaded file chunking with adaptive chunk sizing
3. Add unified acceleration framework supporting all formats (STL, OBJ, STEP, 3MF)
4. Integrate background loading manager with cancellation tokens
5. Implement progressive rendering with LOD (Level of Detail) management
6. Add memory-efficient processing with streaming and cleanup

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: Loading performance, UI responsiveness, memory management
- **Affected code**: All parser modules, core loading infrastructure, UI components
- **Performance improvement**: 4-5x faster loading for large files
- **Memory reduction**: 50% reduction in peak memory usage
- **User experience**: Responsive UI during loading with progress feedback and cancellation

### Migration Notes:
- Existing single-threaded parsing will be maintained as fallback
- New GPU acceleration requires CUDA/OpenCL capable hardware
- Memory usage patterns change significantly - may require system RAM upgrades for very large files
