## Cleanup Action Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Cleanup Preparation
1. **Backup Current State**
   ```bash
   # Create backup of current root directory
   cp -r . ../digital-workshop-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```

2. **Create New Directory Structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p config samples samples/code samples/reports build/installer build/logs archive
   ```

### Phase 2: File Movement Operations

#### Step 1: Move Documentation Files
```bash
# Create docs subdirectories
mkdir -p docs/guides docs/architecture docs/reports

# Move documentation files
mv QUICK_START_GUIDE.md docs/guides/QUICK_START.md
mv REFACTORING_SOLUTIONS.md docs/guides/REFACTORING.md
mv IMPORT_PROCESS_ARCHITECTURE.md docs/architecture/IMPORT_PROCESS.md
mv FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md docs/reports/FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md
mv WINDOW_PERSISTENCE_TEST_GUIDE.md docs/guides/WINDOW_PERSISTENCE.md
mv vtk_resource_tracker_fix_summary.md docs/reports/VTK_RESOURCE_TRACKER.md
```

#### Step 2: Move Test Files
```bash
# Create test subdirectories
mkdir -p tests/unit tests/integration tests/framework tests/parsers tests/persistence tests/themes tests/performance tests/runner

# Move test files
mv test_*.py tests/unit/
mv comprehensive_test_suite.py tests/integration/
mv comprehensive_test_suite_tests.py tests/integration/
mv unified_test_runner.py tests/runner.py
mv test_framework_*.py tests/framework/
mv test_gcode_*.py tests/parsers/
mv test_*_persistence.py tests/persistence/
mv test_*_theme*.py tests/themes/
mv test_*_performance*.py tests/performance/
```

#### Step 3: Move Analysis and Report Files
```bash
# Create reports subdirectories
mkdir -p reports/json reports/html reports/analysis reports/comprehensive reports/performance reports/quality reports/test_results

# Move report files
mv *_report.json reports/json/
mv *_report.html reports/html/
mv *_analysis.json reports/analysis/
mv comprehensive_*_report.md reports/comprehensive/
mv shutdown_analysis_report.md reports/analysis/
mv performance_*.json reports/performance/
mv naming_*.json reports/quality/
mv test_results.* reports/test_results/
```

#### Step 4: Move Development Tools
```bash
# Create tools subdirectories
mkdir -p tools/quality tools/analysis tools/debug tools/exceptions tools/migration tools/demos

# Move development tools
mv code_quality_validator.py tools/quality/
mv naming_validator.py tools/quality/
mv quality_gate_enforcer.py tools/quality/
mv monolithic_detector.py tools/analysis/
mv debug_detection.py tools/debug/
mv create_exceptions.py tools/exceptions/
mv migrate_models.py tools/migration/
mv error_handling_demo*.py tools/demos/
mv monolithic_report.json tools/analysis/
```

#### Step 5: Move Configuration Files
```bash
# Move configuration files
mv quality_config.yaml config/
mv test_framework_config.json config/
mv pyinstaller.spec config/
mv installer.nsi config/
```

#### Step 6: Move Sample Files
```bash
# Move sample files
mv sample/ samples/
mv sample_large_module.py samples/code/
mv sample_small_module.py samples/code/
mv sample_*_report.json samples/reports/
mv sample_report.json samples/reports/
```

#### Step 7: Move Build Files
```bash
# Move build files
mv installer/ build/installer/
mv build_*.log build/logs/
```

#### Step 8: Archive Temporary Files
```bash
# Move temporary files to archive for review
mv mon archive/
mv n archive/
mv P archive/
mv validate archive/
mv quality archive/
mv -p/ archive/
mv .augment/ archive/
```

### Phase 3: Post-Cleanup Validation

#### Step 1: Verify File Movements
```bash
# Check that all expected files have been moved
echo "Checking file movements..."
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f | wc -l  # Should be significantly reduced
```

#### Step 2: Update Import Statements
```bash
# Check for any hardcoded paths that need updating
grep -r "test_" src/ || echo "No hardcoded test paths found"
grep -r "reports/" src/ || echo "No hardcoded report paths found"
```

#### Step 3: Test Functionality
```bash
# Run basic functionality tests
python run.py --help
python -m pytest tests/ -v
python build.py --help
```

## Validation Checklist

### Pre-Execution Validation
- [ ] Backup created successfully
- [ ] New directory structure created
- [ ] All essential files identified and marked for retention
- [ ] File movement commands tested on sample files
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared

### Post-Execution Validation
- [ ] Root directory file count reduced from 100+ to ~12 essential files
- [ ] All moved files exist in their new locations
- [ ] No duplicate files created
- [ ] Essential files remain in root directory
- [ ] Application still starts: `python run.py --help`
- [ ] Tests still run: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
- [ ] Build still works: `python build.py --help`
- [ ] No import errors in source code
- [ ] Documentation still accessible
- [ ] Configuration files still load correctly

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] Core application functionality preserved
- [ ] Test suite runs without errors
- [ ] Build process completes successfully
- [ ] Quality gates still function
- [ ] Development tools still work
- [ ] Reports still generate correctly

### Directory Structure Validation
- [ ] New directory structure matches plan
- [ ] All directories created successfully
- [ ] File permissions preserved
- [ ] No broken symbolic links
- [ ] Archive directory contains temporary files for review

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Operations
1. **File Movement**: Risk of breaking imports or references
   - **Mitigation**: Backup first, test functionality after each phase

2. **Configuration Files**: Risk of breaking application startup
   - **Mitigation**: Keep essential configs in root, test startup after move

3. **Test Files**: Risk of breaking test execution
   - **Mitigation**: Verify pytest still works after test file relocation

### Rollback Plan
If cleanup causes issues:
```bash
# Restore from backup
rm -rf *
cp -r ../digital-workshop-backup-[timestamp]/* .
```

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- Root directory file count: Reduce from 100+ to ≤15 files
- Organization improvement: 100% of files categorized and properly located
- Functionality preservation: 100% of existing features work post-cleanup

### Qualitative Metrics
- Improved developer experience: Easier navigation and file discovery
- Reduced cognitive load: Clear separation of concerns
- Better maintainability: Logical organization structure
- Enhanced onboarding: New developers can quickly understand project structure

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Approval**: Stakeholder review of cleanup plan
2. **Execution**: Run cleanup script during low-usage period
3. **Validation**: Execute validation checklist
4. **Documentation Update**: Update project documentation to reflect new structure
5. **Team Communication**: Inform team of changes and new file locations
6. **Archive Review**: Review archived temporary files and remove if safe

## Conclusion

This cleanup plan will transform the Digital Workshop root directory from a cluttered collection of 100+ files into a clean, organized structure with essential files in the root and everything else properly categorized in logical subdirectories. The plan preserves all functionality while significantly improving project organization and maintainability.
