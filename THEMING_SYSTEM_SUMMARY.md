# Theming System Summary

Overview

The theming system has been merged into main, providing a centralized ThemeManager, a visual Theme Manager widget with live preview, and full GUI/CSS integration across the application.

Key components

- Theme registry and defaults: [src/gui/theme.py](src/gui/theme.py)
  - 148 named color variables
  - Central API to get/set variables with safe fallbacks
  - WARNING-level logging when variables are undefined

- Visual theme editor: [src/gui/theme_manager_widget.py](src/gui/theme_manager_widget.py)
  - Live preview of changes as you edit
  - Structured sections for easier navigation

- Application integration:
  - Main window: [src/gui/main_window.py](src/gui/main_window.py)
  - Metadata editor: [src/gui/metadata_editor.py](src/gui/metadata_editor.py)
  - Model library: [src/gui/model_library.py](src/gui/model_library.py)

- Styles converted to variables: [src/resources/styles/main_window.css](src/resources/styles/main_window.css)

- Documentation: [src/resources/docs/color_reference.md](src/resources/docs/color_reference.md)

Usage

1) Launch the application:

   python run.py

2) Open the Theme Manager:

   View → Theme Manager...

3) Edit colors and verify the live preview updates immediately.

4) Apply changes. If a variable is missing, a visible fallback color will appear and a WARNING log entry will be written.

5) Restore defaults at any time from within the Theme Manager.

Behavior and guarantees

- Normal operation shows no hot-pink fallback colors.
- Fallback system kicks in only for missing variables and logs WARNINGs.
- Application stability is preserved even when variables are missing.
- Full restoration after tests has been validated.
