# Application Freeze Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was freezing in two scenarios:
1. During startup when initializing the Feeds & Speeds widget
2. When clicking on the Files tab in the model library

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Feeds & Speeds Widget Blocking on Library Import
**File:** `src/gui/feeds_and_speeds/feeds_and_speeds_widget.py`

**Problem:** 
- The `__init__()` method called `_load_default_library()` which imported a large JSON file (IDCWoodcraftFusion360Library.json) on the main thread
- This blocked the UI during application startup

**Solution:**
- Moved library loading to async using `QTimer.singleShot()`
- Created `_load_default_library_async()` method that defers the import to the next event loop iteration
- Created `_import_library_in_background()` method to handle the actual import
- UI now initializes immediately, and library loads in the background

### Issue 2: File Browser Tree View Freezing
**File:** `src/gui/multi_root_file_system_model.py`

**Problem:**
- When the Files tab was clicked, the tree view was displayed
- Qt automatically calls `hasChildren()` and `rowCount()` for all visible items
- These methods called `_ensure_children_loaded()` which did a blocking `path.iterdir()` call
- This froze the UI when expanding directories, especially large ones or network drives

**Solution:**
- Modified `hasChildren()` to return `True` for directories without loading children (non-blocking)
- Modified `_ensure_children_loaded()` to only use pre-indexed data from background indexing
- Removed the blocking `path.iterdir()` fallback code
- Added `dataChanged` signal emission when background indexing completes to refresh the view
- Tree now shows expand arrows immediately, and children appear as background indexing completes

## Changes Made

### 1. `src/gui/feeds_and_speeds/feeds_and_speeds_widget.py`
- Added `QTimer` import
- Changed `__init__()` to call `_setup_ui()` first, then `_load_default_library_async()`
- Added `_load_default_library_async()` method
- Added `_import_library_in_background()` method

### 2. `src/gui/multi_root_file_system_model.py`
- Modified `hasChildren()` to return `True` for directories without blocking
- Modified `_ensure_children_loaded()` to only use indexed data, removed blocking filesystem access
- Added `dataChanged` signal emission in `_on_indexing_complete()`
- Added caching of file metadata (_file_size, _file_type, _modified_time) in TreeNode

### 3. `src/gui/model_library_components/library_ui_manager.py`
- Added logging to track file browser creation progress

## Testing

The fixes have been verified to:
✅ Allow the application to start without freezing
✅ Allow clicking through all main tabs without freezing
✅ Allow clicking on the Files tab without freezing
✅ Show file tree with expand arrows immediately
✅ Populate tree with files as background indexing completes

## Performance Impact

- **Startup time:** Slightly faster (library import no longer blocks UI)
- **Files tab responsiveness:** Immediate (no blocking operations)
- **Memory:** Minimal increase (caching file metadata)
- **Background indexing:** Continues in background thread as before

## Future Improvements

1. Add progress indicator for background indexing
2. Add cancellation support for background indexing
3. Implement incremental tree expansion (only load visible nodes)
4. Add caching of indexed data to disk for faster startup
