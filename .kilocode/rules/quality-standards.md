- Module-level docstrings explaining purpose
- Usage examples in documentation folder
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues

## Development Process Standards

**Code Review Requirements:**
- All code must pass code review before integration

- Security review for data handling

**Debugging Standards:**
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features
- Clear error messages for users
- Detailed logs for developer debugging

**Quality Gates:**
- All todos must pass Test and Debug steps
