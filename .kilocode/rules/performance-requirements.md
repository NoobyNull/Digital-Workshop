# Performance Requirements Rule

## Load Time Requirements

**Target Load Times:**
- 3D model files under 100MB: < 5 seconds
- 3D model files 100-500MB: < 15 seconds
- 3D model files over 500MB: < 30 seconds

**Performance Optimization:**
- Adaptive loading based on hardware capabilities
- Progressive rendering for large files
- Memory-efficient processing
- Background loading with progress feedback

## Memory Usage Requirements

**Memory Management:**
- No memory leaks during repeated operations
- Stable memory usage during stress testing
- Efficient cleanup of unused resources
- Adaptive memory allocation based on available RAM

**Resource Limits:**
- Maximum memory usage: 2GB for typical usage
- Model cache size: Adaptive based on available RAM
- Texture memory: Optimized for GPU capabilities

## Responsiveness Requirements

**UI Responsiveness:**
- Interface remains responsive during file loading
- Progress feedback for all long operations
- Cancellation support for lengthy operations
- Smooth interaction during model manipulation

**Frame Rate Requirements:**
- Minimum 30 FPS during model interaction
- Consistent frame rates across different model sizes
- Adaptive frame rate based on system capabilities
- VSync enabled for tear-free rendering
