# 3D-MM Research Knowledge Workflow

## Research Management Process

**When to Research:**
- Before implementing new features
- When troubleshooting complex issues
- During performance optimization
- For technical decision making

**Research Documentation:**
- Document all findings with context and references
- Include code examples and implementation patterns
- Note decision rationale and alternatives considered
- Update with new discoveries during development

**Debug Mode Integration:**
- Check existing research before new investigation
- Reference documented solutions for known issues
- Add new findings to prevent future re-research

**Ask Mode Enhancement:**
- Context-aware research using existing knowledge
- Gap identification for missing information
- Research documentation for future reference

## Knowledge Base Structure

**Technical Decisions:**
- Framework choices and rationale
- Architecture patterns and implementation approaches
- Performance optimization strategies

**Implementation Research:**
- Code examples and configuration patterns
- Troubleshooting guides and known issues
- Best practices and recommended approaches

**Reference Materials:**
- Documentation links and resources
- Code examples and implementation patterns
- Performance benchmarks and optimization techniques

## Research Update Protocol

**After Research:**
- Document findings with sufficient context
- Include code examples and implementation patterns
- Note decision rationale and alternatives considered
- Reference source materials and documentation

**During Implementation:**
- Update research with actual implementation experience
- Document any deviations from planned approach
- Record performance characteristics and optimization results

**For Issue Resolution:**
- Document root cause analysis and solution approach
- Include troubleshooting steps and verification methods
- Update prevention strategies for similar future issues
