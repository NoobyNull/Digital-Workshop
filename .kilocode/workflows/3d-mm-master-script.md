# 3D-MM Master Script Workflow

## Todo Execution Process

**Linear Progression:**
1. Set up project directory structure
2. Implement JSON logging system with rotation
3. Create SQLite database schema
4. Implement basic PySide5 application structure
5. Create STL file parser
6. Implement PyQt3D viewer widget
7. Create model library interface
8. Implement metadata editing system
9. Implement search functionality
10. Add additional format parsers (OBJ, 3MF, STEP)
11. Optimize load times
12. Create application packaging
13. Final testing and documentation

## Quality Assurance for Each Todo

**Standard Process:**
- Test: Verify module creates proper logs during operations
- Test: Run operations 10-20 times, monitor memory usage for leaks
- Code Reviewer: Review code for sanity and efficiency
- Code Simplifier: Refactor code for better performance if possible
- Debug: Fix any issues found
- Documentation: Document the component

## Mode Usage Patterns

**Architect Mode:**
- Design and planning activities
