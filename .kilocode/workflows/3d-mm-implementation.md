# 3D-MM Implementation Workflow

## Project Overview

3D-MM is a Windows-native desktop application for organizing and viewing 3D model collections with a focus on hobbyist users.

## Technical Architecture

**Framework:** PySide5 with PyQt3D
**Database:** SQLite with metadata management
**3D Engine:** Qt3D for model visualization
**Target Users:** Hobbyists organizing 3D model collections

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- JSON logging system with rotation
- SQLite database schema
- Basic PySide5 application structure

### Phase 2: Core Features
- STL file parser
- PyQt3D viewer widget
- Model library interface
- Metadata editing system

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- Search functionality
- Additional format parsers (OBJ, 3MF, STEP)
- Load time optimization
- Application packaging

## Implementation Guidelines

**Code Organization:**
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Performance optimization for large file handling

**Quality Assurance:**
- Follow quality-standards rule for all code
- Adhere to performance-requirements rule
- Meet system-requirements specifications

**Testing Approach:**
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Performance testing for load times
- Memory leak testing through repeated operations
