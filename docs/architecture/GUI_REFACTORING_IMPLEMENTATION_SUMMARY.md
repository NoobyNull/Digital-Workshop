## Integration Guidelines

### 1. Using the Enhanced Viewer Service
```python
from src.gui.services.enhanced_viewer_service import EnhancedViewerService
from src.gui.services.ui_service import ViewerUIService

# Initialize services
ui_service = ViewerUIService(parent_widget)
viewer_service = EnhancedViewerService(viewer_widget, ui_service)

# Load model asynchronously
success = viewer_service.load_model_async(file_path)

# Monitor progress
viewer_service.set_progress_callback(progress_callback)

# Cancel loading if needed
viewer_service.cancel_loading()
```

### 2. Using the Theme System
```python
from src.gui.services.enhanced_theme_service import EnhancedThemeService

theme_service = EnhancedThemeService(ui_service)

# Apply theme asynchronously
theme_service.apply_theme_async("dark_mode")

# Preview theme temporarily
theme_service.preview_theme_temporarily("blue_theme", 3000)

# Validate theme
is_valid, error = theme_service.validate_theme("theme_name")
```

### 3. Using Material Management
```python
from src.gui.services.material_service import MaterialService

material_service = MaterialService(ui_service)

# Validate material
is_valid, error = material_service.validate_material(material_data)

# Get material preview
preview = material_service.get_material_preview("wood_oak")

# Search materials
results = material_service.search_materials("metal")
```
