## Detailed Analysis Results

### Linting Analysis Summary

| Category | Count | Priority | Impact |
|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| Missing Type Hints | 2,800+ | High | Code maintainability and IDE support |
| Import Issues | 350+ | Medium | Code organization and clarity |
| Line Length Violations | 200+ | Low | Code readability |
| Missing Docstrings | 150+ | Medium | Documentation and maintenance |
| Exception Handling | 50+ | High | Application stability |

### Architectural Improvements Identified

1. **MainWindow Decomposition**
   - Extract WindowStateManager for window state persistence
   - Create MenuManager for menu handling
   - Separate ToolbarManager for toolbar operations
   - Implement DialogCoordinator for dialog management
   - Create LayoutManager for layout operations
   - Extract ShortcutManager for keyboard shortcuts
   - Implement EventCoordinator for event handling

2. **ModelLibrary Refactoring**
   - Extract ModelDataManager for data operations
   - Create ModelTableManager for table view management
   - Separate ModelGridManager for grid view operations
   - Implement ModelSearchManager for search functionality
   - Create ModelSortFilterManager for sorting/filtering
   - Extract ModelContextMenuManager for context menus
   - Implement ModelViewCoordinator for view synchronization

### Technical Debt Assessment

**High Priority Issues:**
- Large monolithic classes requiring immediate refactoring
- Missing comprehensive error handling in critical paths
- Lack of type hints affecting maintainability
- Insufficient logging for production debugging

**Medium Priority Issues:**
- Import organization inconsistencies
- Docstring coverage gaps
- Code duplication in UI components
- Inconsistent naming conventions

**Low Priority Issues:**
- Line length violations in documentation strings
- Minor code style inconsistencies
- Unused imports in test files
