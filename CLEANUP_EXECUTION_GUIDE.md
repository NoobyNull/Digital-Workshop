# Digital Workshop Root Directory Cleanup - Execution Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for executing the comprehensive cleanup plan for the Digital Workshop root directory. The cleanup will reorganize 100+ scattered files into a logical directory structure while preserving all functionality.

## Deliverables Summary

The cleanup plan includes the following deliverables:

1. **ROOT_DIRECTORY_CLEANUP_PLAN.md** - Comprehensive cleanup plan with detailed analysis
2. **cleanup_root_directory.sh** - Unix/Linux/macOS cleanup script
3. **cleanup_root_directory.bat** - Windows cleanup script  
4. **validate_cleanup.py** - Post-cleanup validation script
5. **CLEANUP_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md** - This execution guide

## Pre-Execution Checklist

### System Requirements
- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed
- [ ] Sufficient disk space (2x current project size for backup)
- [ ] Appropriate permissions to create directories and move files
- [ ] No active processes using files in the Digital Workshop directory

### Backup Verification
- [ ] Ensure backup location has sufficient space
- [ ] Verify backup creation will succeed
- [ ] Confirm rollback procedure is understood

### File Integrity
- [ ] All essential files are present (README.md, pyproject.toml, etc.)
- [ ] No critical processes are running that might lock files
- [ ] Current working directory is the Digital Workshop root

## Execution Instructions

### Option 1: Unix/Linux/macOS Systems

1. **Make the script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x cleanup_root_directory.sh
   ```

2. **Run the cleanup script:**
   ```bash
   ./cleanup_root_directory.sh
   ```

3. **Monitor the output:**
   - The script provides colored progress indicators
   - Watch for any error messages
   - Note the backup location for future reference

### Option 2: Windows Systems

1. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator**

2. **Navigate to the Digital Workshop directory:**
   ```cmd
   cd /d "path\to\digital-workshop"
   ```

3. **Run the cleanup script:**
   ```cmd
   cleanup_root_directory.bat
   ```

4. **Monitor the output:**
   - Watch for progress messages
   - Note any error messages
   - Remember the backup location

### Option 3: Manual Execution

If you prefer to execute the cleanup manually or need to troubleshoot:

1. **Create backup first:**
   ```bash
   # Unix/Linux/macOS
   cp -r . ../digital-workshop-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   
   # Windows
   xcopy . ..\digital-workshop-backup-%date:~-4,4%%date:~-10,2%%date:~-7,2% /E /I /Q
   ```

2. **Create directory structure:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p config samples samples/code samples/reports build/installer build/logs archive
   mkdir -p docs/guides docs/architecture docs/reports
   mkdir -p tests/unit tests/integration tests/framework tests/parsers tests/persistence tests/themes tests/performance tests/runner
   mkdir -p reports/json reports/html reports/analysis reports/comprehensive reports/performance reports/quality reports/test_results
   mkdir -p tools/quality tools/analysis tools/debug tools/exceptions tools/migration tools/demos
   ```

3. **Move files according to the plan in ROOT_DIRECTORY_CLEANUP_PLAN.md**

## Post-Execution Validation

### Automatic Validation

Run the validation script to automatically check cleanup success:

```bash
python validate_cleanup.py
```

This script will:
- Verify file count reduction
- Check essential files are present
- Validate directory structure creation
- Test basic functionality
- Generate a detailed report

### Manual Validation Steps

1. **Check root directory file count:**
   ```bash
   # Should be significantly reduced from ~100+ files
   ls -la | wc -l  # Unix/Linux/macOS
   dir /b /a-d | find /c /v ""  # Windows
   ```

2. **Verify essential files:**
   ```bash
   ls README.md pyproject.toml requirements.txt run.py build.py
   ```

3. **Test application startup:**
   ```bash
   python run.py --help
   ```

4. **Test build functionality:**
   ```bash
   python build.py --help
   ```

5. **Test pytest configuration:**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest --collect-only -q
   ```

6. **Check new directory structure:**
   ```bash
   tree -L 2 -a  # Unix/Linux/macOS (if tree is installed)
   dir /s /b | find "config\|samples\|build\|archive"  # Windows
   ```

## Expected Results

### Before Cleanup
- Root directory: ~100+ files
- Poor organization
- Difficult navigation
- Cluttered development environment

### After Cleanup
- Root directory: ~12 essential files
- Clear organization by file type
- Logical directory structure
- Improved developer experience

## Rollback Procedure

If issues arise after cleanup, restore from backup:

### Unix/Linux/macOS
```bash
# Remove current state
rm -rf *

# Restore from backup
cp -r ../digital-workshop-backup-[timestamp]/* .
```

### Windows
```cmd
# Remove current state (use with caution)
del /q /s *.*

# Restore from backup
xcopy "..\digital-workshop-backup-[timestamp]\*.*" . /E /Y
```

**Note:** Replace `[timestamp]` with the actual backup directory name created during cleanup.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Permission denied" errors
**Solution:** Run with appropriate permissions or as administrator

#### Issue: "File not found" during cleanup
**Solution:** This is normal - some files may not exist. The script handles missing files gracefully.

#### Issue: Application won't start after cleanup
**Solution:** 
1. Check that essential files are still in root directory
2. Verify Python path configuration
3. Restore from backup if necessary

#### Issue: Tests fail after cleanup
**Solution:**
1. Check that test files were moved correctly
2. Verify pytest configuration
3. Update any hardcoded paths in test files

#### Issue: Import errors in source code
**Solution:**
1. Check for hardcoded paths to old file locations
2. Update import statements if necessary
3. Restore from backup if critical

### Getting Help

1. **Check the cleanup summary file** generated during execution
2. **Review validation report** from validate_cleanup.py
3. **Examine backup directory** to understand what was moved
4. **Consult ROOT_DIRECTORY_CLEANUP_PLAN.md** for detailed file categorization

## Success Metrics

## Conclusion

This cleanup operation will significantly improve the Digital Workshop project organization while preserving all functionality. The comprehensive plan includes safety measures, validation steps, and rollback procedures to ensure a smooth transition.

For questions or issues during execution, refer to the troubleshooting guide or restore from backup using the rollback procedure.

**Remember:** The backup is your safety net. If anything goes wrong, you can always restore the original state.
